# OMT-Staff-Credits

This is a website for displaying a list of staffs in an osu! tournament called Orang's Mini Tournament June 2021.

Forum post:

To do:
- [ ] Change Site icon on top bar
- [ ] Search feature: By staff name
- [ ] Search feature: By roles
- [ ] Search feature: By osu! userID
- [ ] Add another background behind the orange background, for OMT bur background image purpose
- [ ] Narrow the orange background to focus more at the center of the site
- [ ] Move staff name closer to the avatar
- [ ] Make the staff "cards" more fancy (haven't thought deeply yet)
